Trying to stay alive after each wave of zombie attacks by being solo or teamates to help you over come longer periods of time. To always make sure to have the doors blocked and earning of points to unlock better weapons or rooms

## Garry's Mod

I have not played this game and hear good things about it like learning the layout and buying better weapons with your teamates. I would have loved to try it if I could.
